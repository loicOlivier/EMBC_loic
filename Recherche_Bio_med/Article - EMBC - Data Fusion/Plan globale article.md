### Abstract
Will be written once most of the job is done (we need to know the conclusion and other stuff that will come once the experimentation will be done)

### Introduction

- I would mention the usefulness of data fusion, especially __EMG__ and __BIO-Z__ : *Combining Bioimpedance and EMG Measurements for Reliable Muscle Contration Detection*. I could resume the general conclusion of the article and how that affects us in our research. 

- Key elements to mention : Real-time gesture classification, a crucial need for low latency and responsivity.
- I should address the reasons of this article. Here I am talking of *novelty*, basically what is new : 
	- Low latency data fusion
	- Realtime multisensor fusion
	- Dataset (will probably be made public)
	- Biopoint : A compact and efficient device for low latency data fusion. 

### Methodology
- System Hardware : Biopoint & Bridge
- Sensor Fusion : 
	- Preprocessing
	- Feature extraction
- Testing : ?
