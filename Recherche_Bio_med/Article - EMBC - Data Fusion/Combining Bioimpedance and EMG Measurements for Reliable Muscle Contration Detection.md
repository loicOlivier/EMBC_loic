## Problem with EMG 
_Mechanical disturbances to the electrodes are in the same frequency and amplitude range as the desired signal_
	- This means that you are stuck with noise that you can't filter out since it has the same frequency properties as the information you are interested in.
	- Here is a reason for EMG fusion with other data
	

## General conclusion
*By combining EMG and bioimpedance measurements, muscle contractions can be detected much more reliably.*
	Confirms the interest of data fusion

## EIM (electrical impedance myography)
- Much higher frequency than EMG
- Helps the filtering of motion artifacts
- Magnitude and phase of BioZ are also of great usage

## Physiological source of EMG and EIM signals
_The major difference between both the signals is, that EMG detects muscle activations, whereas EIM detects actual muscle contractions._
- EMG : Muscle activations
- EIM (electrical impedance myography) : muscle contractions.

## Things to discuss after 
- Bioimpedance is measured both in *magnitude and phase*. 
	- Variable current 100 uA - 1000 uA
	- Higher frequencies than the Biopoint 50k to 333k
