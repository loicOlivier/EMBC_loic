	MATLAB Youtube Series on Data Fusion (Xavier's suggestion)
## Defining Sensor Fusion

_Combining two or more data sources in a way that generates a **better** understanding of the system_
	where better actually refers to being more consistent and /or more accurate !

## How can Data Fusion help ?

1. Increase the quality of the data
	- For exemple, let's say you combine a gravity sensor with a gyroscope sensor. You can better distinguish data from noise because you will be able to tell if the spike from the Mag is also manifesting in the sensor.
